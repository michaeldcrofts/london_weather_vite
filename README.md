# London_Weather_Vite

A small app to display a three day forecast for London weather. Ordinarily my go-to for this would be to use HTML elements with a bunch of CSS and a sprinkling of vanilla JS. However, here I've used the HTML Canvas element almost exclusively with a copious amount of TypeScript and powered by a Vite Node JS server: all of which I have had to increase my familiarity with in order to make this. It's been great fun!

Notable features:
- Dynamic rescaling of the canvas for portrait and landscape view, scaled to window size to mimic css media queries.
- Dynamic rescaling of font-size to fit the area assigned to text and avoid bleed. 
- Data bound text and image regions to only update areas of the canvas that need changing, following an asynchronous data update. This allows for smoother screen updating with no flicker.
- Layout management achieved using a screen map with unitised functions for drawing.
