# London_Weather_Vite

A small app to display a three day forecast for London weather. Ordinarily my go-to for this would be to use HTML elements with a bunch of CSS and a sprinkling of vanilla JS. However, here I've used the HTML Canvas element almost exclusively with a copious amount of TypeScript and powered by a Vite Node JS server: all of which I have had to increase my familiarity with in order to make this. It's been great fun!
